    Bleach (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese anime television 
    series based on Tite Kubo's original manga series of the same 
    name. It was produced by Pierrot and directed by Noriyuki Abe. 
    The series aired on TV Tokyo from October 2004 to March 2012, 
    spanning 366 episodes. The story follows the adventures of Ichigo 
    Kurosaki after he obtains the powers of a Soul Reaper—a death 
    personification similar to the Grim Reaper—from another Soul 
    Reaper, Rukia Kuchiki. His newfound powers force him to take on 
    the duties of defending humans from evil spirits and guiding departed 
    souls to the afterlife. In addition to adapting the manga series it is 
    based on, the anime periodically includes original self-contained 
    storylines and characters not found in the source material.
