    <i>Naruto</i> is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by 
    Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young 
    ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming 
    the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts:
    the first is set in Naruto's pre-teen years (volumes 1-27), and the 
    second in his teens (volumes 28-72). The series is based on two one-shot
     manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable
    mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).

    Naruto is one of the best-selling manga series of all time, having 250 million 
    copies in circulation worldwide in 47 countries and regions, with 153 million 
    copies in Japan alone and remaining 97 million copies elsewhere. It has become 
    one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their English translations of 
    the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller list 
    several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers 
    praised the manga's character development, storylines, and action sequences, 
    though some felt the latter slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, 
    which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references from Japanese 
    mythology and Confucianism.
